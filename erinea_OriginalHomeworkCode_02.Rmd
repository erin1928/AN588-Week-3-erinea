## Challenges

I learned how to best import an image into my Rmarkdown from my peers as I was struggling with adding images that were easy to access via R and view on the final knit of my html file.

The major difference in my code that I didn't see in my peers code was the inclusion of upper.tri(TRUE) when solving the first homework problem. I used this method as a way to call the greater than or equal to parameter. My peers used 1 - ppois(q = 8, lqmbda = 15) to account for this variable which I thought was a unique and creative way of solving the same problem.

I thought that overall this homework was relatively straight forward. The coding issues I struggled with most I was able to fix either via reviewing the modules or from the peer feedback I received on my initial homework code.

I thought the comments my peers left me were very helpful, kind, and overall improved my understanding of the assignment. I enjoyed looking through my peer's code and seeing how they chose to tackle the same problem, and felt like I learned a lot through their feedback and problem solving processes.

## What is the probability she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?
```{r 8 or more calls, include=TRUE}
eight_calls <- ppois(q = 8, lambda = 15, upper.tri(TRUE))
eight_calls
```
## Probability of no calls
```{r no calls, include=TRUE}
no_calls <- dpois(x = 0, lambda =15)
no_calls
```
## Probability of exactly 3 calls
```{r exactly 3, include=TRUE}
three_calls <- dpois(x = 3, lambda =15)
three_calls
```
## Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.
```{r Poisson mass function, include=TRUE}
x <- 0:30
l = 15
probset <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)
barplot(probset, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Probability", main = "Probability Mass Function")
```

## Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions)
```{r simulate 104 results, include=TRUE}
two_years <- rpois(104, lambda =15)
two_years
```

## Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30
```{r final plot, include=TRUE}
hist(two_years, probability = TRUE, main = "Two Years of Data",
    xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "probability", xlim = c(0,30))
```
